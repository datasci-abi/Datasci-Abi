### Hi there, I'm Abisek Raut! 👋

I am a data scientist and software developer with a passion for transforming complex data into actionable insights and innovative software solutions. With expertise in Python, MySQL, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing, I thrive at the intersection of data analysis and software development.

🔭 I’m currently leading the development of the **Bandersnatch project**, an ambitious initiative designed to integrate dynamic visualizations and interactive machine learning models within a robust web application. This project showcases my commitment to pushing the boundaries of technology to enhance user engagement and understanding through data.

🌱 While I have mastered several technologies, I am always on the lookout for new tools and methodologies to further enhance my skill set and contribute to my projects.

👯 I’m open to collaborations, looking to work with other creative and driven individuals on innovative projects that challenge the status quo.
