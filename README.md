### Hi there, I'm Abisek Raut! 👋

I am a data analyst currently transitioning from a background in various technology sectors. My focus now lies in harnessing Python, MySQL, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing to extract meaningful insights from data.

🔭 I’m currently leading the **Bandersnatch project**, a groundbreaking initiative that utilizes advanced technology to deliver dynamic visualizations and interactive machine learning models through a web application. This project highlights my dedication to using sophisticated data tools to enhance understanding and facilitate informed decision-making.

🌱 I am continually expanding my expertise in data analysis by exploring new tools and techniques that push the boundaries of what we can achieve with data.

👯 I’m eager to collaborate with other enthusiasts and professionals in the field of data science to tackle challenging problems and develop innovative solutions.
